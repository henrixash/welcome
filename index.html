                    College of Arts and Sciences (CAS) as a strong and vibrant service and degree-offering college, the first among equals, in a premier university. Contributory to the Mission of the Nueva Vizcaya State University and in line with its vision of a strong and vibrant college, the College of Arts and Sciences shall provide general education courses to all students from the other colleges of the University, and to serve the special needs of other colleges for major courses in the disciplines of the Arts and Sciences. It shall also offer relevant degree courses that stand to benefit the community in particular and the global community in general. The College of Arts and Sciences is geared towards the preparation of students for responsible, creative and useful membership and leadership in the society through innovative designed to stimulate and develop creative, analytical and critical thinking, effective communication and sound judgment, without sacrificing aesthetic, ethical and cultural values.

                <p class="text-justify">Presidential Decree No. 195 converting the Nueva Vizcaya Agricultural College into Nueva Vizcaya State Institute of Technology, expanding for this purpose its curricular programs in technology, signed by President Ferdinand Marcos took effect on May 22, 1973. With the creation of the College of Arts and Sciences in 1979, was the expansion of course offerings, among which was the BS in Computer Science.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">Since its inception in 1979, the CAS was just a service college to support the degree programs of the then NVSIT. Its first Dean was Dr. Felix B. Gacad, but some things are meant for greater purpose. The college went through revolutionary changes and worked hard for the approval of its first degree program. By virtue of Board of Trustees Resolution No. 192 s. of 1983, the BS Mathematics program was approved. However, the college started offering the course only in 1990-1991 with seven ‘trial’’ enrollees during the term of Dean Emilia I. Bareng.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">With the guidance of the Lord coupled with committed and hardworking faculty of the college, the endeavor proved to be a successful venture because four years later, two of the original enrollees graduated cum laude while five of them passed the Professional Board Examination for Teachers (PBET). This record of excellence set the standards for the succeeding batches and this was further confirmed by the 1999 graduating class when it posted a 100% passing rate in the Licensure Examination for Teachers (LET).
                <span id="dots" style="display: none;"></span></p>
                <span id="morehis" style="display: none;">
                <p class="text-justify">This lasting legacy is a proof of the dedication of the faculty to produce quality graduates as evidenced by the high passing rates of graduates in the year 2002, 2004, 2008 and 2009. Moreover, the BS Mathematics program has already submitted its requirement for Accreditation and successfully attained the Level 3, Phase 2 from the Accrediting Agency of Chartered Colleges and Universities of the Philippines, Inc. (AACCUP). The said program is also scheduled for AACCUP Accreditation evaluation for Level 4, Phase 1 anytime next year.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">The success of the BS Math program has stirred the successors to initiate the opening of a new course. With the growing number of qualified faculty, the college has successfully earned the nod of the administration to open the Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS) program during the term of Dean Ernesto P. Granole. The offering of the BSCS was approved by virtue of Board of Trustees Resolution No. 35, s. of 1998. It started with 29 enrollees. The program has already achieved Level 3, Phase 2 in the AAACUP Accreditation.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">On June 15, 2007, another course was introduced by the college. The Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) was approved by virtue of Board of Regents Resolution No.19, s. of 2007 through the initiative of Dean Dr. Loreta R. Galima. Currently, the program has achieved Level 2 in the AACUP Accreditation.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">Driven by dedication and excellence, the college envisioned to offer additional programs to cater the diverse needs of students. It has bravely ventured into proposing Bachelor of Science in Biology and Bachelor of Science in Information Systems in 2016 during the term of Dean Dr. Julius S. Valderama.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">After the rigorous preparation of documentary requirements, backed up by the strong composition of the CAS faculty, the two programs had finally paid off when they were approved after undergoing the CHED Regional Assessment Team (RQAT) evaluation during the leadership of the current Dean Dr. Filemon A. Pamittan. On August 2019, by virtue of Board Resolution No.059, s. of 2019, Bachelor of Science in Biology and Bachelor of Science in Information Systems with 65 and 25 enrollees respectively were officially opened. Prof. Daniel Marvin B. Ramel is the first Program Coordinator of BS Biology while Prof. Frances Mary Ann R. Belen is the current Dept. Chair. For the BS Information Systems program, Prof. Jayson C. Irabagon is its current Program coordinator while Prof. Rodelyn M. Aguinaldo is the Dept. Chair of BSIS.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">The college has also applied for the addition of new programs namely: Bachelor of Arts in Political Science, Bachelor of Science in Chemistry and Bachelor of Arts in Communication and have undergone the necessary CHED RQAT evaluation. These programs are hoped to be offered soon.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">For the Graduate Programs, Master of Science in Teaching Mathematics (MST-Math) and PhD in Science Education major in Mathematics, have also underwent AACCUP Accreditation and are already recognized by Department of Science and Technology (DOST) as a Higher Education Institution to cater DOST scholars.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">Indeed, the CAS has morphed from a humble service college to one of the biggest college of the University with a total number of 851 students currently enrolled for SY 2020-2021. These modest achievements show that the college will continually strive to accomplish more, all for the sake of quality service and education.</p>
